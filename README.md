## 2024 MDDN342 Assignment 2: Randomised Collections

>part 1:I uploaded my sketches, inspired by emojis. I made a collection of flat card emojis.
>
>part 2:Try editing the face.js file to draw a collection of face shapes, and Set my color palette. ![image](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/randomised-collection-nanzelas/assets/90404037/b330a842-5adc-47d7-98c7-b12d3a5d6a4d)
>
>Part 3:I implemented a basic random set where I could randomly assign my five sets of faces and randomly color them. I finally settled on the parameter "int(random(1,6))" so that I can get 1,2,3,4,5 at random. Five values correspond to five face.![image](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/randomised-collection-nanzelas/assets/90404037/371586b9-8bd6-434b-a146-cff189d59648)
>
>Part 4:I tried experiments with weighted selection and conditional randomness. My weighting assignment is the weight of the colors of the five bodies. blue 20%, green 10%-20%, purple 60%-80%, orange 20%-50%, red 80%-100% ![image](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/randomised-collection-nanzelas/assets/90404037/a57380b8-fb0d-475d-a11f-595919d47e8f)
>Experiments of conditional randomness control eye patterns through body color.![image](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/randomised-collection-nanzelas/assets/90404037/955e1158-3237-41ac-ad7c-1963a87ed30e)
